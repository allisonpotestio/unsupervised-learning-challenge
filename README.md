# unsupervised-learning-challenge
# project summary

This challenge involved analyzing the file crypto_market_data.csv using the K means and PCA methods of unsupervised learning.
The data is cleaned using pandas and loaded into these models
An elbow curve is created for each of these processes to determine the number of clusters for each analysis.
By comparing the elbow curves and clusters, I determined that the K means model allowed us to more effectively analyze the data, since this data set did not lend itself to creating more clusters.

# dependencies
Python libraries- pandas, hvplot, sklearn 


# resources

I referred to the Module 19 class activities to complete this challenge, 
along with reviewing the code during a tutoring session
